# Chess Platform

I've wanted to make a chess platform for a long time, and I'm excited to finally get started! This project is inspired by the chess websites I play on: chess.com and lichess.org. Beyond my passion for chess, this project is a way for me to get hands-on experience with modern tech stacks and start developing and monetizing apps of my own.

## Tech Stack
### Frontend
- TypeScript
- React
- Vite
- Tailwind CSS

### Backend
- Node.js
- TypeScript
- Fastify
- WebSockets

### Database
- PostgreSQL
- Prisma
